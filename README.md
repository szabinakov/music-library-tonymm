# Music Library API:

This is a Node.js Express API for managing artists and albums data. It provides HTTP endpoints for Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting (CRUD) artists and albums. The API uses the HTTP methods:

- POST for creating new artists and albums
- GET for retrieving artists and albums data
- PUT for updating an entire artist or album
- PATCH for partially updating an artist or album
- DELETE for deleting an artist or album

## Installation:

To use this API in your project, you need to set up a PostgreSQL database to store the artists and albums data. You can use a Docker container to run the PostgreSQL server and initialise the database.

1. First clone the repo and install all dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/tonymm55/music-library

cd <your-repository>

Run the command: npm install

2. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your system if it's not already installed

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of this repository with the following parameters:

   PGUSER=postgres
   PGHOST=localhost
   PGPASSWORD=password
   PGDATABASE=music_library_dev
   PGPORT=5432
   PORT=3000

4. Run the docker container with:

docker run --name music-lib -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -d postgres

5. Start the API server:

Run the command: npm start
